## How-To

When you start DashEngine, you will see an update screen. If there isn't a newer version, the next thing you'll see is the main screen. If there is an update, it will be downloaded and installed.

You will see a blackboard on the main screen. This is the chess board you will be playing on. On the left you will see two tabs, "Game Info" and "Settings". On the "Game Info" tab you can see some statistics such as the current search depth or the last moves played. You can view recent moves at the bottom of this tab. However, you can only make a move when you are in the last position on the board. On the Settings tab, you can see the current version and some settings at the bottom. Every change is saved on your computer.
If you don't want to see any of the tabs, just click the red X to hide it (you can show it back later if you want).

In the middle you can see the chess board with black and white pieces (you always play the white pieces). You will see a timer in the top and bottom right corners. This timer represents the remaining time to play. You can change how long you want to play on the Settings tab. If your or the AIs timer reaches 0, you lose. When you want to restart the game, click the gray button under the Settings tab. It's called "New Game".

Have fun!
